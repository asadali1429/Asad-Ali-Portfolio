🎮 VR Active Shooter Training Simulation
----------------------------------------

A VR training experience built in **Unity with Hurricane VR**, where the player takes on the role of a teacher during an **active shooter scenario**.The project is designed around the **Run, Hide, Fight** protocol, providing a realistic and educational environment to practice emergency decision-making.

Players can:

The simulation emphasizes **realistic VR hand interactions, NPC student behavior, and immersive audio/visual feedback** to heighten tension and train situational awareness.It also includes dynamic scenarios, fail/success states, and a final performance report based on player actions and timing.
